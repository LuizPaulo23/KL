# {KL}

The `KL` package provides functions for calculating the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. This package is useful for a wide range of applications, including machine learning, data analysis, and statistical inference, where comparing probability distributions is essential.

## Description

The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is a statistical distance that quantifies the discrepancy between relative frequencies (or, more precisely, between two probability distributions). Given a reference probability distribution \( P \), it seeks to compare it with another probability distribution \( Q \). Defined over the same event space \( X \), it is expressed as follows:

$$
D_{KL}(P || Q) = \sum_{x \in X} P(x) \log\left(\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\right)
$$

For distributions \( P \) and \( Q \) of a continuous random variable:

$$
D_{KL}(P || Q) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) \log\left(\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\right) dx
$$
