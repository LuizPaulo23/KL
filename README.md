# {KL} Divergence Package

This R package provides tools to calculate and analyze the **Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence**, a statistical measure that quantifies the discrepancy between two probability distributions. Given a reference distribution \( P \), the KL divergence assesses how different a second distribution \( Q \) is from \( P \). This metric is widely used in information theory and has applications across machine learning, statistical inference, and data science.

## Key Features

- **KL Divergence Calculation**: Functions to compute KL divergence for discrete and continuous probability distributions.
- **Distribution Comparison**: Tools for comparing observed frequencies or probability distributions in various contexts.
- **Visualization**: Built-in plotting functions for visualizing the divergence between distributions.
- **Applications**: Example workflows for using KL divergence in model evaluation, hypothesis testing, and information gain analysis.
